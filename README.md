# AL Family of Trees: Champion's Edition

## Contributors

The project is built on the Meteor framework

### Getting Started

1. Clone this project and `cd` into the directory

2. If you haven't done so already,
[Install meteor](https://www.meteor.com/developers/install)

3. Run `meteor npm install --save @babel/runtime react react-dom`
**note: This step appears to be a bug. Shouldn't need to do this**

4. `run meteor`

You should see your app running on http://localhost:3000
