<img src="home_screen_mockup.png" alt="Mockup of app home screen" width="200"/>

## Getting Started

The project is built on the Meteor framework

1. Clone this project and `cd` into the directory

2. If you haven't done so already,
[Install meteor](https://www.meteor.com/developers/install)

3. Run `meteor npm install --save @babel/runtime react react-dom`
**note: This step appears to be a bug. Shouldn't need to do this**

4. run `meteor`

You should see your app running on http://localhost:3000

## Deploy

`meteor deploy al-family-of-trees.meteorapp.com --free --mongo`

The app is live at http://al-family-of-trees.meteorapp.com/

It's hosted on the free plan so it may take a couple of minutes for Meteor cloud to bring it up from a cold start.
